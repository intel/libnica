DISCLAIMER
-----------

This library is undergoing an active development cycle. It is currently being
developed _in tandem_ with multiple projects, and as such the ABI and API should
be considered currently unstable.

Scheduled changes:

 - Thread pool
 - Timing tests on all data types (and relevant improvements)
 - N-ary tree addition
 - List API changes
 - Move from C99 to C11
 - Thread-safe APIs (Atomic)
 - Improved file access functions
 - mmap helpers (RAII based)
 - Improved INI parser (lex-based w/ line continuation)
 - Fold in cve-check-tool changes/additions
 - Potential:
   - Fold in the templating mini-lib from new cve-check-tool
   - Simplified networking access (retaining underlying transparency)

**Common C library functions**


Lightweight library containing common functionality of typical "C utility libs".

Currently contains:

 - Dynamic array
 - List type
 - Simplified file manipulation functions (mkdir_p, rm_rf, etc)
 - A Hashmap implementation
 - A simple, efficient, INI File parser
 - Safe string manipulation functions for when strlen is out of the question

The majority of the API is designed to work on a RAII principle, using scope-based
`autofree` helpers (see util.h) with minimal fuss.

Another important principle to keep in mind while hacking on `libnica`, is that
memory leaks of any description in a successful usage, are forbidden. This includes
any "possibly lost" memory through static initialisation as seen with heavier
libraries.
